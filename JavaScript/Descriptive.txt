1. Characteristics of JavaScript:
   - JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language.
   - It is primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages.
   - JavaScript is executed by web browsers.
   - It's versatile and can be used both on the client-side and server-side (Node.js).
   - Supports event-driven, asynchronous programming.
   - Has a dynamic and loosely typed nature.
   - Provides a variety of built-in objects and functions for common tasks.

2. Function of the return statement:
   - The `return` statement is used in functions to specify the value that the function will produce as output.
   - When a function encounters a `return` statement, it immediately exits and returns the specified value to the caller.

3. Local and global variables:
   - Local variables are declared within a specific function and have local scope, meaning they can only be accessed within that function.
   - Global variables are declared outside of any function and have global scope, making them accessible from anywhere in the code.

4. Difference between while and do-while loop:
   - `while` loop: It tests the condition before executing the loop's code block. If the condition is false initially, the code block may not execute at all.
   - `do-while` loop: It executes the code block first and then tests the condition. This ensures that the code block runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

5. Function of break and continue statements:
   - `break`: It is used to exit a loop prematurely, stopping the loop's execution.
   - `continue`: It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.

6. Array:
   - An array is a data structure in JavaScript used to store and manage a collection of values or elements.
   - You can declare an array using square brackets `[]`, like this: `var myArray = [1, 2, 3];`

7. Difference between "==" and "===" operator:
   - "==" checks for equality of values, performing type coercion if necessary (e.g., 1 == '1' evaluates to true).
   - "===" checks for strict equality, comparing both values and data types (e.g., 1 === '1' evaluates to false).

8. "with" statement:
   - The "with" statement is used to simplify code by providing a shorthand way to access properties of an object.
   - Syntax: `with (object) { /* code that can reference object's properties directly */ }`

9. DOM (Document Object Model):
   - The DOM is a programming interface for web documents.
   - Properties of the DOM include `document`, `getElementById()`, `getElementsByTagName()`, etc.

10. History object:
    - The `history` object in JavaScript provides access to the browser's navigation history.
    - Common methods include `go()`, `back()`, and `forward()`, which allow you to manipulate the browser's navigation history.
